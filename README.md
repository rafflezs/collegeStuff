## :notebook: What is this?
My personal repo for college work/projects. Mostly programing problems (as I'm not planning to post math stuff).

## :rocket: Can I use it?
Well, perhaps. Most college problems aren't the same, as most college doest not have the exact same teacher/metodology.
Feel free to use it, answer question, as long as you don't copypasta into your code.
Not that I'm adding a LICENSE, it's just that it's better for you to learn and understand what you're doing at your pace.
